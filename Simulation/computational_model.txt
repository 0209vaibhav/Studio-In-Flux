Computational Model for the Simulation
=====================================

1. Initialization Phase
----------------------
- Load UI: `index.html` loads, attaching scripts and styles.
- Global Variables Setup: Simulation parameters, grid, agents, desks, UI controls, statistics, and heatmap variables are initialized.
- Setup Functions: 
  - `setup()`: Initializes the simulation environment, UI elements, and event listeners.
  - `setDefaultEntryExit()`, `setDefaultEntry()`, `setDefaultExit()`: Set up entry/exit points for agents.

2. Environment & Agent Preparation
----------------------------------
- Grid Creation: 2D grid representing the studio is created.
- Desk Placement: 
  - `placeDesksInDivisions()`: Desks are placed according to user-selected arrangement and division.
- Operator (Agent) Initialization: 
  - Agents are created with assigned desks and initial positions.
  - `findValidSpawnPoint()`: Determines valid spawn points for agents.

3. Main Simulation Loop
-----------------------
- Loop Control: Driven by animation frame or timer.
- User Input Handling: 
  - UI controls (sliders, buttons) and mouse events (`mousePressed()`) allow user to modify parameters, pause, reset, or interact with the simulation.
- Simulation State Update:
  - `updateOperators()`: Each agent senses the environment, computes the next move (using pathfinding like Dijkstra), and updates its state (position, interaction with desks, exit).
  - `findNextMove()`, `findPathWithDijkstra()`, `isValidMove()`: Pathfinding and movement logic.
  - `updateHeatMap()`: Tracks and updates the heatmap of agent movements.
  - `calculateMoveCost()`: Computes movement cost for pathfinding.
- Statistics Update:
  - `updateStatistics()`: Updates stats like desks interacted, operators completed, etc.
  - `calculateLayoutScores()`, `calculateEfficiencyScore()`, `calculateSpaceUtilizationScore()`, `calculateComfortScore()`: Computes layout and performance scores.

4. Rendering/Display
--------------------
- Draw Functions:
  - `draw()`: Main rendering function, called each frame.
  - `drawGrid()`, `drawDivisions()`, `drawDesks()`, `drawOperators()`, `drawEntryExitPoints()`, `drawHeatMap()`, `drawHeatMapLegend()`, `drawTrailLengthLegend()`: Visualize the environment, agents, heatmap, and legends.
- UI Updates:
  - `updateScoreDisplay()`, `updateSliderLimits()`, `updateValues()`: Update UI elements and feedback.

5. Output & Feedback
--------------------
- Display Results: Visual feedback, statistics, and scores are shown to the user.
- User Interaction: User can pause, reset, or modify the simulation and see immediate feedback.

6. Termination/Restart
----------------------
- End Condition: Simulation can be paused, reset, or restarted by the user.
- Reset: 
  - `resetSimulation()`: Resets all variables and restarts the simulation.
